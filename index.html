            <h2>Cyber XXXInfrastructure Research & Development Lab for the Earth Sciences</h2>

		<p><strong>CIRDLES</strong> is an undergraduate computer science software engineering initiative at the <a href="http://www.cofc.edu" target="_blank">
			The College of Charleston </a>, Charleston, SC.  We specialize in the collaborative development of free open source software to support science domains.
			This material is based upon work supported by the National Science Foundation under Grant Numbers 0930223 and 1443037.</p>

		<p><strong>CIRDLES</strong> is creating free open source cyber infrastructure for geochronology in an interdisciplinary collaboration among our
			software engineers and undergraduate research assistants and geochemists and their student researchers, including those from two NSF-supported initiatives,
			<a href="http://www.earth-time.org/" target="_blank">EARTHTIME</a> and <a href="http://www.earthchem.org//" target="_blank">EarthChem</a>.
			The <a href="http://www.earth-time.org/" target="_blank">EARTHTIME</a> initiative is a community-supported network of geologists and
			geochemists focused on providing the tools necessary for high-precision sequencing of earth history using an integration of radioisotopic
			dating and stratigraphy. The <a href="http://www.earthchem.org//" target="_blank">EarthChem</a> project is designing data repositories for
			 all geochemical data, including radioisotopic geochronological data.</p>

<hr>
		<blockquote><p><strong>CIRDLES</strong> members are designing and building a novel and exemplar end-to-end system for geochronological
			data processing workflows that links data production to data archiving. The principal software component is <a href="/projects/et_redux/">ET_Redux</a>
			and supports uranium-lead geochronology.  We are extending <a href="/projects/et_redux/">ET_Redux</a> in 2015-2018 to include uranium-series geochronology.
			  <a href="/projects/et_redux/">ET_Redux</a> serves as the template for future efforts to process all geochronological data such as other radioisotopic
				systems involving 40Ar/39Ar, U-Th-He, and Lu-Hf. As part of the end-to-end workflow architecture implemented with <a href="/projects/et_redux/">ET_Redux</a>,
				we also are developing <a href="/projects/chroni/">CHRONI</a> as a mobile application that accesses and displays archived sample analyses.
				One novel and important aspect of the project is to integrate pedagogical and learning aids into the software products we develop. For example,
				the data reduction algorithms and the equations for the propagation of uncertainty will have interactive graphical interfaces to provide
				transparency and to enhance understanding.</p></blockquote>
<hr>
	<p><strong>CIRDLES</strong> is also supporting the earth sciences community by leading the development of free open source a replacement for
		Ken Ludwig's ISOPLOT with the <a href="/projects/topsoil/">Topsoil</a> project.  Additionally, we are hosting a <a href="/projects/commons/">Commons</a>
		where we will provide specific implementation and services for the community.</p>

		<h3>Here at CIRDLES, we are dedicated to attaining these goals:</h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Learn the foundational aspects of domain-specific software engineering from our work with geochemists;</li>
			<li>Develop software to serve as cyber infrastructure for geochronology - providing services from data analysis to data archiving and compilation;</li>
			<li>Work to benefit both computer science and the earth sciences;</li>
			<li>Provide research opportunities for undergraduate students; and </li>
			<li>Support the teaching efforts of both software engineers and geochemists by producing tangible, open-source artifacts with and for students.</li>
		</ul>
